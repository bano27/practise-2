        <h2>Dean Henderson</h2>
        <p>Confident throughout and showcased his distribution with an effortless pass to Brandon Williams. Much more vocal than David de Gea and a fine save late on.<strong>8/10</strong></p>
        <br>
        <h3>Juan Mata Garcia</h3>
        <p>Put United 1-0 up just before half-time with a penalty to become their only player to score in every post-Ferguson season.<strong>6/10</strong></p>
        <br>
        <h4>Donny Van De Beek</h3>
        <p>Encouraging with and without the ball and selflessly fashioned a chance for Juan Mata and had an effort stopped by James Shea.<strong>7.5/10</strong></p>
